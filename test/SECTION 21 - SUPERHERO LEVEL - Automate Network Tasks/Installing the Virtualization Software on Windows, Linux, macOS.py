ARISTA virtual engine

Arista is changing their downloads page and releasing new images on a regular basis and it's hard for a course to keep up with weekly changes such as these. However, if the Arista vEOS version in the course does not fully match the Arista vEOS version that you find on the official website, then you should download the closest version to the one in the course and also keep an eye on the format of that image's name.

For instance, if in the course I am using vEOS-lab-4.23.0.1F.vmdk, but that is no longer available at the time you're watching the course, then you can look for the closest version to that, such as vEOS-lab-4.23.3M.vmdk.

The commands and features should be 99% that same.

Best wishes,
